Please file an issue for any pull requests and then link that issue to your PR. After a PR is merged, we will close the associated issue with it. I do not want this project to focus on anything more than a CLI application. Bushy Packs should stay focused on sourcemod powered game servers and not try to expand. I will add more to this later, if needed.
